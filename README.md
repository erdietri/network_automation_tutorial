# Network Automation Tutorial
This Python tutorial is meant for high school and college students who are both learning to code and are new to network engineering. As such, this README will deviate from typical structure to ensure it can be followed by students.

## What is network engineering?
Do you use the Internet? ...That's a network. Do you have wifi at home? ...That's your home network! 

Computers are great, but we can't share the things we make (i.e. e-mail, using social media, uploading a YouTube video) unless computers can talk to one another. (Keep in mind, many things can be a computer -- your cell phone is a computer!)

When you can connect computers so that they can talk to one another, that's a network.

There are many rules for how computers can get information from one another, and there are many tech devices in between to facilitate that communication; the intricacy and complexity of designing, maintaining, and troubleshooting this is why network engineering exists.
