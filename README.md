# Network Automation Tutorial
This Python tutorial is meant for college students who are both learning to code and are new to network engineering. As such, this README will deviate from typical structure to ensure it can be followed by students.

## Intro to Network Automation 

### What is network engineering?
Do you use the Internet? ...That's a network. Do you have wifi at home? ...That's your home network! 

Computers are great, but we can't share the things we make (i.e. e-mail, using social media, uploading a YouTube video) unless computers can talk to one another. (Keep in mind, many things can be a computer -- your cell phone is a computer!)

When you can connect computers so that they can talk to one another, that's a network.

There are many rules for how computers can get information from one another, and there are many tech devices in between to facilitate that communication; the intricacy and complexity of designing, maintaining, and troubleshooting this communication is why network engineering exists.

### What is automation?
"Automation" is the word we use for when we want to take a task that we usually have to do manually and to have it happen automatically. 

Sometimes we have to be the ones to write the code to make this happen. When this happens, we use a type of programming language called a scripting language to write the automation, or script. We use these languages because they are languages that are not required to be "compiled" in order to run, which adds time. Some common examples of scripting languages include Python, Bash, and Powershell; these are all languages that are instead "interpreted." 

Other times, someone has built a product that allows us to create automations. This is often called "no-code" or "low-code" because actual coding isn't required; instead, we use a drag-and-drop interface to visually create the automation.

### Putting it together: understanding network automation

If automation makes boring manual tasks happen automatically, and network engineering is the field that ensures computers are talking to one another; then network automation makes boring, tedious, or repetitive tasks in network engineering automatic.

It can be difficult to know how to automate something that you aren't doing every day. For instance, if every day, you have to organize the files on your computer, you would have a better understanding of how to write a script, or automation, to organize them.

However, if you want to work in IT or as a network engineer, knowing how to create automation will serve you well (and may very well be a requirement). Likewise, software engineers are often asked to learn networking concepts to create network automation. And of course, there are a number of job titles that fall along this spectrum (i.e. DevOps Engineer, Cloud Engineer). 

## Create Your First Network Automation
For this tutorial, we will provide partial guidance through writing your first script to work with Cisco networking or security products. 

### Requirements
Before we get started, make sure you have both Python3 and a Python-compatible developer environment, or IDE, installed. (I recommend VS Code.)
* Install VS Code, making sure to choose the correct operating system - https://code.visualstudio.com/download
* Download Python3, making sure you choose the correct operating system - https://www.python.org/downloads/
* Follow the Python3 installation instructions based on your operating system - https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/install-python/#how-to-install-python
